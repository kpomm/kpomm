### Welcome to my Page

I am a junior from Dartmouth College studying Computer Science and Physics. My interests include full-stack web development, UI/UX design, machine learning, and data science. I am currently a Creative Technologist Intern at Hume AI with intentions to pursue Software Engineering as a full time career. 

ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on my personal portfolio website and a side project for my Digital Applied Learning and Innovation (DALI) Lab application at Dartmouth College. 

ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning TypeScript at Hume AI, and learning to transform Figma prototypes into functional frontend components that match the company's creative vision. 

ðŸ’¬ Ask me about using AI for good and how to implement it into projects! 

âš¡ Fun fact: I have a cat named Pie ðŸ¥§
