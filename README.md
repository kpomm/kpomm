### Welcome to my Page

I am a junior from Dartmouth College studying Computer Science and Physics. My interests include full-stack web development, UI/UX design, machine learning, and data science. 


ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on my personal portfolio website and taking two cs classes: Machine-Learning and Software Design and Implementation. 

ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning C and Machine-Learning. 

ðŸ’¬ Ask me about using AI for good and how to implement it into projects!
