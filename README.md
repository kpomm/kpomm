### Welcome to my Page

I am a junior from Dartmouth College studying Computer Science and Physics. My interests include full-stack web development, UI/UX design, machine learning, and data science. 


ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on a one-page static site that plays with unconventional UI. 

ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning about cool frontend UI packages.

ðŸ’¬ Ask me about using AI for good and how to implement it into projects! 

âš¡ Fun fact: I have a cat named Pie ðŸ¥§
